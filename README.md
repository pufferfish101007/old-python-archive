# Old python archive

This is what remains of my old python code from school. Some of it is better than others.

## fighter.py

This is a genuinely entertaining (IMO) fighter game based around the premise of getting Nicola Sturgeon, the then-leader of the Scottish National Party, into the seat of Prime Minister. Highly silly but it functions. In its original state except from one typo fix and one bugfix to avoid fighting Boris Johnson before encountering the final boss (which is Boris Johnson).

## battleships.py

A mostly functioning text-based game of battleships. You can play against a really dumb computer if you want.

## maze.py

I think this is meant to generate and solve a maze? It doesn't really work at all though.
